# Smart Parking System

## Project Title
**Car Parking Sensor Using ATmega32, Ultrasonic Sensor, LCD Display, LEDs, and Buzzer**

---

## Objective
The aim of this project is to design a simple car parking sensor system that helps drivers detect obstacles and avoid collisions while parking. The system measures the distance between the car and an obstacle using an ultrasonic sensor and displays the distance on an LCD screen. LEDs and a buzzer provide visual and auditory warnings based on the proximity of the object.

---

## Overview
This project utilizes an **ATmega32 microcontroller** to process distance data from an ultrasonic sensor and display the results on an LCD. The system includes **three LEDs** (Red, Green, and Blue) and a buzzer for indicating the proximity of an obstacle. The LEDs light up progressively, and the buzzer activates as the obstacle gets closer, helping drivers park safely.

## Features
- **Ultrasonic Distance Measurement:** Measures the distance between the car and any nearby object.
- **LCD Display:** Displays the measured distance in centimeters and shows "Stop" if the distance is less than 5 cm.
- **LED Indicators:** Three LEDs (Red, Green, and Blue) light up according to the proximity of the obstacle.
- **Buzzer Alert:** Sounds when the object is too close (<= 5 cm).
- **Dynamic LED Behavior:**
  - **Distance <= 5 cm:** All LEDs flash (Red, Green, Blue), Buzzer sounds, LCD shows "Stop."
  - **6 cm <= Distance <= 10 cm:** All LEDs ON (Red, Green, Blue), No buzzer.
  - **11 cm <= Distance <= 15 cm:** Red and Green LEDs ON, Blue LED OFF.
  - **16 cm <= Distance <= 20 cm:** Only Red LED ON, others OFF.
  - **Distance > 20 cm:** All LEDs OFF, Buzzer OFF.

## Hardware Components
1. **ATmega32 Microcontroller**
2. **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**
3. **16x2 LCD Display**
4. **Red, Green, and Blue LEDs**
5. **Buzzer**

---

## Operation Description
1. The ultrasonic sensor emits an ultrasonic wave and listens for its reflection from a nearby object.
2. The ATmega32 microcontroller calculates the distance by measuring the time taken for the wave to return to the sensor.
3. The measured distance is displayed on the LCD in centimeters.
4. The system continuously updates and recalculates the distance, providing real-time feedback to the driver.

## Driver Requirements

### GPIO Driver
- Handles the configuration and control of input/output pins.

### ICU Driver
- Manages the Input Capture Unit to measure the pulse time generated by the ultrasonic sensor.
- Includes functions for initialization, setting up a callback, and capturing rising and falling edges.

### Buzzer Driver
- Provides the following functions:
  - **Buzzer_init():** Initializes the buzzer pin and turns it OFF initially.
  - **Buzzer_on():** Activates the buzzer.
  - **Buzzer_off():** Deactivates the buzzer.

### LCD Driver
- Operates a 16x2 LCD in 4-bit mode for displaying text and distance values.
- Includes functions for initialization and displaying strings or numerical values.

### Ultrasonic Driver
- Implements the ultrasonic distance measurement:
  - **Ultrasonic_init():** Initializes the ICU and configures the ultrasonic sensor.
  - **Ultrasonic_Trigger():** Sends a trigger pulse to the ultrasonic sensor.
  - **Ultrasonic_readDistance():** Captures the time of reflected waves and calculates the distance.
